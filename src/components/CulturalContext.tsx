        <p>
          <strong>Kifuliiru</strong> is the language spoken by the <strong>Bafuliiru</strong> (also known as 
          <strong> Abafuliiru</strong>) people. The Bafuliiru are the traditional inhabitants of 
          <strong> Ibufuliiru</strong>, their ancestral homeland and kingdom in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Kifuliiru language is part of the Bantu language family and is spoken by approximately 
          200,000-300,000 people in the South Kivu region of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

          Ibufuliiru represents the traditional territory and cultural heartland of the Bafuliiru people, 
          encompassing their historical kingdom and chiefdom structures that have existed for centuries 
          before colonial boundaries were established.

          Current Situation of Kifuliiru
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Endangered Status:</strong> Kifuliiru is currently classified as a vulnerable language, 
          facing significant threats from urbanization, migration, and the dominance of French and Swahili 
          in education and official contexts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Documentation Gap:</strong> Prior to our work, Kifuliiru had minimal written documentation, 
          with no comprehensive dictionaries, grammar books, or educational materials available. This lack 
          of resources threatened the language's transmission to younger generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Community Challenges:</strong> The Bafuliiru people face challenges in maintaining their 
          linguistic heritage due to limited access to education in their native language, economic pressures 
          that drive migration to urban centers, and the absence of digital content in Kifuliiru.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Our Impact:</strong> Through our computational methods and community engagement, we have 
          created over 141,000 books in Kifuliiru, providing the Bafuliiru people with unprecedented access 
          to educational materials in their native language, helping to reverse the trend of language loss.
