          <p>
            <strong>Primary Question:</strong> Can our Kifuliiru Lab's template-based computational generation produce 
            authentic, pedagogically-sound educational content for the Kifuliiru language with minimal existing 
            written materials?
          </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Methodology:</strong> Multi-platform approach combining (1) systematic generation 
        via mathematical formulas and linguistic templates, (2) community-powered content 
        creation through digital platforms, (3) voice recording and audio preservation, 
        and (4) integrated web and mobile applications for comprehensive language access.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Validation:</strong> All generated content undergoes multi-stage community review 
        including native speaker verification and elder cultural validation.
      </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Our Kifuliiru Lab methodology can successfully transform the Kifuliiru language 
            from minimal documentation to a comprehensive digital ecosystem. Through template-based generation 
            combined with community validation, we can create authentic educational materials that preserve 
            and revitalize the unique linguistic and cultural heritage of the Bafuliiru people.
