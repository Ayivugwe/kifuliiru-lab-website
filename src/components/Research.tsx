        <strong>Primary Question:</strong> Can template-based computational generation produce 
        authentic, pedagogically-sound educational content for languages with minimal existing 
        written materials?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Methodology:</strong> Dual-track approach combining (1) systematic generation 
        via mathematical formulas and linguistic templates, and (2) community-powered content 
        creation through digital platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Validation:</strong> All generated content undergoes multi-stage community review 
        including native speaker verification and elder cultural validation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Hypothesis:</strong> This methodology is language-agnostic and can scale to the 
        3,000+ endangered languages globally. Each language will have its own dedicated 
        laboratory under the Wekify LLC umbrella, applying our proven methodologies 
        to preserve and revitalize their unique linguistic heritage.
