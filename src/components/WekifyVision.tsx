            <strong>Our Mission:</strong> Wekify LLC is dedicated to preserving and revitalizing 
            endangered languages worldwide through specialized language laboratories, starting with 
            the Kifuliiru language. Each endangered language receives its own dedicated language laboratory research facility, ensuring 
            culturally-appropriate and linguistically-accurate preservation efforts.
          </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Kifuliiru Lab:</strong> As our flagship laboratory, we have developed and 
        proven our approach with the Kifuliiru language. Our success here demonstrates 
        the scalability and effectiveness of our methods for other endangered languages.
      </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Future Language Laboratories:</strong> We are actively working to establish 
            additional language laboratories for other endangered languages, each with their 
            own dedicated team, community partnerships, and specialized research focus.
          </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scalable Framework:</strong> Our proven approach—combining computational 
        linguistics, innovative methods, and community engagement—provides a 
        replicable framework that can be adapted for any language community.
